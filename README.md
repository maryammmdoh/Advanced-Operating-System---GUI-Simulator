# Advanced-Operating-System---GUI-Simulator

## Overview
This project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) simulator** designed for **Advanced Operating System (AOS) concepts**. It provides an interactive way to understand and experiment with key **Operating System algorithms** related to **memory management, page replacement, and disk scheduling**.

The project is implemented using **Python** and **Tkinter** for GUI elements, making it easy for students and developers to visualize OS processes dynamically.

---

## Features
- **Page Replacement Algorithms** (FIFO, LRU, Optimal)
- **Disk Scheduling Algorithms** (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK)
- **GUI-Based Interaction** for simulating different OS algorithms
- **Graphical Representation** of memory and disk operations
- **User Input Fields** to customize simulations
  
---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Matplotlib (for graphical representation)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Future Enhancements
- Improve the GUI layout and usability
- Add more OS algorithms

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or later). You also need to install Tkinter and Matplotlib if they are not already included.

### Install Required Libraries
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
